         <h2 class="section_head" id="about-me">• About me</h2>
         <p>
         Hi! My name's Ian. As of September 2025, I'm a Research Engineer at Google&nbsp;DeepMind. Previously, I was a Research Engineer at <a href=https://far.ai>FAR.AI</a>, contracted with OpenAI building Dangerous Capability and AI R&amp;D evaluations, ran the <a href=https://openreview.net/pdf?id=DwgRm72GQF>Inverse Scaling Prize</a>, and was a software engineering intern at <a href=https://ought.org>Ought</a>.
         Before that, I did an MSc Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh.
         Even more before that, I graduated from the University of St Andrews
         with an MPhys Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (an integrated master's degree).
         </p>
         <p>
          I got involved in AI safety research because I became concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AGI
           during my undergrad and came to the conclusion that working to ensure that
          future AI is safe and beneficial for everyone is the most valuable thing I could do.
         <h2 class="section_head" id="what-ive-done">• What I've done</h2>

         <p>Even before discovering that AI research was what I wanted to do, I'd been
            working my way towards programming as my main interest. It started with a
            simple programming assignment in a maths module, followed by some small
            Javascript projects done in my spare time. I found it so engaging and
            <em>fun</em> that I started judging my module choices by how much coding they'd
            let me do.
         </p>
         <p>Below is a selection of things that I've done, which will be updated as I
            find time to write about them (i.e. rarely: last update 2020). Technically this website is an example of a project I've
            worked on, but graphic design is not one of my core competencies, as evidenced
            by the upcoming buttons:

         </button>
         <div class="hidden" id="sa">
           <p>This started as a class project for a maths module (inappropriately
              named Symbolic Computation). I decided to implement <a
                 href=https://bit.ly/2o1eYvE>Simulated
              Annealing</a> (SA), having been inspired by
              reading about Quantum Annealing for a physics
              assignment.  It quickly expanded from just trying
              to implement the heuristic on the <a
                 href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model>ising
              spin model</a> to applying it also on the <a
                 href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem>Travelling
              Salesman Problem</a> and implementing exact
              solvers for both to check SA's performance.
           </p>

           <p> Here's SA finding the exact solution for ten randomly placed cities (which it did much faster than the deterministic methods): </p>

           <p>The code for this project, and more details, are available on <a href=https://github.com/naimenz/Discrete-Optimisation>github</a>.</p>

            <p>Here is a selection of the small Javascript projects I've done.
               Many were written using the <a href="http://p5js.org/">p5.js library</a>, a choice inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">The
               Coding Train</a>.

                  <h3>Sierpiński Triangle</h3>
                  <p>Using the Iterated Function System method I learnt
                     from a module in Fractal Geometry, I wrote a piece of code
                     that could be repurposed to draw many different fractals.
                     One of the my favourites is the Sierpiński Triangle, which
                     can be created by repeatedly removing the middle triangle
                     from the image, and repeating this on all the smaller
                     versions this creates. Click on the triangle below to
                     generate the Sierpiński Triangle.

                  <h3>Conway's Game of Life</h3>
                  <p> Conway's game of
                     life is the quintessential example of a cellular
                     automaton. Each frame is a 'generation', and the
                     squares (or cells) live or die according to a simple
                     set of rules. Despite this simplicity, the game has
                     been explored in vast depth, as can be seen on 
                     <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">LifeWiki</a>.
                     Below is an implementation I wrote for the Game of Life,
                     again using p5.js. Left click to select cells, right 
                     click to deselect them.

                  <h3>Smart Rockets</h3>
                  <p>These rockets evolve using a genetic algorithm to seek
                     out the Goal &ndash; the red circle at the top of the box
                     &ndash; while trying to avoid the obstacles in the way. Each
                     rocket is assigned a fitness based on how close it got to
                     the goal; the closer it got, the more likely it is to pass on its 'DNA' (set of vectors that define its path) to the next generation. Click and drag to add an obstacle.
